Here we have used Props ,state ,Event Handling using Functional COmponenet

while designing our component using functional component it takes props as parameter
while working with functional component if we need to work with state then we need to use 
useState() hook

In React, Hook means Function .useState(intital value); here useState is fucntion 
which accepts intial value in its parameter for the state variable and state variable will be keep on updating 
with help of setCount() function 

useState() - function returns the variable and fucntion in the form of array destructing.

const [count,setCount] = useState(value); // array destructing
