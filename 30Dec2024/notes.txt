whenever we need to apply the style more one the element / tags
It is called as CSS Combinators.

When we write div space and second is <P> or it can any tag 
then style will appply to child , grandchild of <P> tag .

div p {  
    color: orange;
}

div > p {} it means style will apply to direct child of div Tag 
and it ignore the grand child tag .

div + span : here + sign denotes immediate next of div tag is span.

+ and ~ is works with siblings

+ denotes immediate next element tag
~ it denotes wherever the tag is there ,style will apply

space  works with child and grandchild
> symbol works with direct child 

----------
label ,b {
    background-color: blueviolet;
}

comma , denotes stye will apply to all the tags m child ,grandchild ,etc.
