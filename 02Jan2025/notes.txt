Text align - It specify the horizontal alignment of text within an element.
example : text-align : center

there are 4 text align values : left ,right ,center, justify

important note : the default text align value is left .It means if we dont assign any value 
to text-align property in a html element will assign to left.

when we give text-align : center is often use for headings
when we give text-align : justify ,where every line in paragraph takes up full width of container box.

Important Note : 
Html file 
<body>
    <h1> Text ALign ONe Style </h1>

css File 

h1 ,a {
    text-align: right;
}

Since <h1> is block level Element that means by default it will occupy full width of webbrowser .
<a> tag is Inline element  that means it will occupy only that amount of width of the content.

Block level ELement we can move to right as well ,bcoz it occupy full width of webbrowser
Inline Element we cant move to right side , it occupy the content width .

Inline Elements we can give  next to next and its shows in same line 
Block level element always shows in New Line .

<div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, and <ul> - Block level element

<span>, <a>, <strong>, and <em> - Inline level

important note for text align : justify 
    Dont justify text , long block of text should be left align and dont center large block of text .
