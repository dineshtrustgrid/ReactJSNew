We had Json data saved it in jsondata.json file
In order to make it available for others we have moved Jsondata file to public folder of Vite Demo (07Jan2025 folder)
In order to test whether , jsondata is available to public or not .we need to run server npm run dev.
URL : http://localhost:5173/jsondata.json
if it gives ,Json data available to everyone

this is how we produced the Json data .

In order to Consume the Jsondata we have used different project (06Jan2025) and try to access the Json data 
with the help of fetch("http://localhost:5173/jsondata.json") .then().catch()

to run this project : npm start ( It is parcel project ).
