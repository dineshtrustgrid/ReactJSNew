// SOP - Same origin Policy 
SOP - RUle that is enforced by browser to controll access to data with in web application

what is Origin ?
 Origin is defined by this scheme (protocol) Host name - Domain , and port number 
 ex: https://dinesh.com:443 

Here : https - scheme
      : dinesh.com - Host
      : port - 443 

      Scheme + host + port = Origin

CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing

https://www.amazon.com - amazon Origin

htpps://www.swiggy.com - swiggy origin 

now, amazon origin to access the data of Swiggy origin , then CORS policy 

ex1: https://dinesh.com/
     https://dinesh.com/courses

    http://dinesh.com/ 

    http - scheme ,dinesh.com - domain ,port =80

    now , https can not access http because ,port number is different for https ,http

    https://vinod.dinesh.com/ - if anyone has changed like scheme,domain,port , then we cant access the other origin.
